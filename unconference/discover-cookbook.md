## Why?

Most events struggle to include all the various stakeholders. Many times these exclusions are oversights and can be easily corrected. The DISCOVER Cookboook is a resource for helping event organizers realize those small elements that do exclude folks and give tips on how to avoid them. 

## Outcomes

During the weekend we were able to onboard several new contributors to the DISCOVER Cookbook. Perhaps more importantly there was a resolve to help publish a 3rd edition of the cookbook by the end of the year. To accomplish this we are setting up monthly calls to guide the next edition of the book. This editorial board will be set up separate from the maintainers of the repository, as we are looking to find under represented voices to review any bias that may come into the text. Finally we are working on a blog post and contributions on the difficulties of hosting conferences in the global south.
