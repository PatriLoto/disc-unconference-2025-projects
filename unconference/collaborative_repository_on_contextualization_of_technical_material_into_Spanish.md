## **Project.**
Collaborative repository on contextualization of technical material into Spanish for Latin America as support for reducing language barriers in Open Source projects

## **Issue.**

Nowadays, contextualization efforts are made by different communities, but the material generated is dispersed. There is no unified space or repository that centralizes all the knowledge generated around this topic and allows it to be carried out in a reproducible way. For this reason, many projects have to start from scratch, wasting time and resources and duplicating efforts.

## **Solution.**
Create a collaborative guide and/or repository with the aim of centralising and organising existing knowledge on the contextualization of technical material into Spanish, providing an accessible, inclusive, and easy-to-use knowledge base so that any individual or community can adapt content to the cultural, linguistic, and social needs of the region. The primary goal is to expedite and facilitate the contextualisation of technical materials for Spanish speakers in Latin America, using the knowledge and experiences gained from earlier projects. The resources of the repository could be classified in such categories as best practices, glossary of terms, support tools, methods or procedures, and success stories, among others.

## **Users.**

Users that were kept in mind when thinking about the solution: any community of practice or individual with the need to translate material into Spanish using best practices.

### **Definitions of Key Terms.**

* **Localization**, commonly referred to as L10n, it is essentially the process of modifying a product, service, or content to satisfy the distinct cultural, linguistic, and functional needs of a given target market or region. 
This adaptation transcends mere text translation, aiming to ensure that the content deeply resonates with local consumers as if it were originally created for them.
Essential components of localization encompass the thorough linguistic and cultural modification of digital content, visuals, graphics, and content in general to conform to local preferences and practices and compliance with local conventions, including currencies, date and time formats, and units of measurement. 
Ultimately, the primary objective of localization is to deliver information that appears to be authentically created for the specific target market. 

* **Contextualization**, in the field of translation, this is a thorough examination of the several elements that could change the meaning of a text. 
Among these elements are the linguistic background, which includes the words and phrases surrounding a given term; the cultural background, which reflects the target audience's values, beliefs, and standards; the situational context, which refers to the particular conditions under which the communication occurs; and even more general political and economic elements that could influence meaning. 
Given the cultural and social background of the intended Spanish-speaking audience, translators must fully understand these contextual layers in order to correctly grasp the intended message of the source material and so transmit it in the target language.

* **Translation** is fundamentally the process of interpreting the meaning of words or texts in one language and obtaining an equivalent meaning in another. While this may appear to be a simple linguistic conversion process, it involves finding equivalence in meaning between languages while carefully retaining the original style and context.
